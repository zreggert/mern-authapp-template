# FULL STACK REACT AUTHENTICATION APP

This project is a full stack authentication app that utilizes the MERN stack to create a template for future web applications I will be creating in the future.

The client side is dynamically built using React compenents and pages and routing through React Router. 

The data base is built using MongoDB and server side routing and APIs are built using Node.js and Express.js.

Users can sign up, login, update, and delete their profiles and secure logins are accomplished with JWT.

As an additional feature, users can use Google OAuth to sign in with their Google accounts.
